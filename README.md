# Speed Staking Token ($SST)

## üöÄ Overview

The **Speed Staking Token ($SST)** is a **staking-based execution priority system** built on **Solana**, optimized for **high-frequency traders (HFT), institutions, and market makers**. By staking $SST tokens, traders gain **priority execution**, **reduced fees**, and **bonus rewards** for ultra-fast transactions.

### ‚úÖ Dynamic Fee Discount Calculation
- The more tokens a user stakes, the greater their **fee discount**.
- Locked staking grants **additional fee reductions**.

### ‚úÖ Auto-Compounding Rewards
- Staked rewards are **automatically reinvested** into the user's staking balance, increasing yield over time.

### ‚úÖ Time-Locked Staking Tiers
- Users can **lock tokens for 30, 90, or 180 days** to **boost rewards** and **increase execution priority**.
- **Prevents flash loan abuse** and **ensures long-term participation**.

### ‚úÖ High-Frequency Trading (HFT) Execution Priority
- Orders executed **within 100ms** earn **additional $SST incentives**.
- Designed for **market makers, institutions, and algorithmic traders**.

### ‚úÖ Liquidity Provider (LP) Yield Boost
